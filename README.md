- üìù **Solution Template Generation**: Automatically creates solution files with LeetCode's template code
- üß™ **CPH-Compatible Test Cases**: Test cases are stored in `.txt` files following the CPH format, enabling compatibility with existing CPH workflows
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Integrated Testing**: Run your solution against all test cases directly within VS Code
- üìä **Results Visualization**: Clear display of test results showing passed/failed cases
- üåê **Multi-Language Support**: Supports C++, Python, and Java
